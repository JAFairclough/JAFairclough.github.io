<h2>Background &amp; Research</h2>
<p>Dr. Javari Fairclough is a Social Scientist with a Ph.D. in Human
Development and Family Sciences. He has been trained as an applied
quantitative researcher that uses novel statistical and research
methodologies to address positive youth development and the complex
interplay between the family unit, peers, and problem behaviors (e.g.,
youth aggression, delinquency and substance use) among at-risk youth.
Through these novel and comprehensive analytic methods, Dr. Fairclough
aims to develop effective prevention and intervention strategies that
have the potential to empower and support this vulnerable population as
they transition to young adulthood. One core aspect of his research
centers around identifying the risk factors that contribute to problem
behaviors such as substance use among at-risk/minority youth and young
adults. By examining various social, psychological, and environmental
influences, Dr. Fairclough strives to pinpoint the dynamic factors that
are associated with increases in the probability of engagement in
negative behaviors. Furthermore, he is dedicated to investigating the
protective factors (e.g., religiosity,parental involvement, parental
monitoring) that can mitigate risk and promote positive developmental
outcomes for at-risk individuals. This includes an exploration of
resilience factors, coping mechanisms, and supportive resources that can
serve as influential buffers against problem behaviors. Dr. Fairclough’s
future research methodology will involve a combination of rigorous
quantitative approaches (e.g., person centered approaches like latent
class analysis, multi-dimensional growth mixture models), qualitative
follow-up investigations, and evidence-based interventions. By
leveraging a multidisciplinary approach, his objective is to generate
comprehensive and practical insights that lead to effective prevention
and intervention strategies for at-risk youth and young adults
struggling with several negative developmental outcomes (e.g., mental
health issues), and problem behaviors like delinquency and substance
use. Ultimately, his research endeavors to foster improved well-being,
social integration, and positive growth among at-risk individuals. To
date, Dr. Fairclough has made great strides in establishing a strong
program of research by publishing three articles (including one first
author article addressing religiosity as a protective factor) and
producing six peer-reviewed research presentations (3 first author).
Another five manuscripts are currently in preparation.</p>

<div id="research-program-areas" class="section level2">
<h2>Research Program Areas</h2>
<p>A cornerstone of Dr. Fairclough’s research is investigating
protective factors for at-risk youth and young adults. As such, he
previously has investigated the extent to which religiosity is
associated with lower rates of delinquency and substance use among urban
African American adolescents in the United States. By using a finite
mixture modeling technique (i.e., Latent Class Analysis), he was able to
examine the heterogeneity in five religiosity items among a sample of
adolescents. The findings showed that three religiosity classes were the
best fit to the data and protective effects of religiosity on substance
use (e.g., alcohol) and delinquency were found (e.g., assault)
(Fairclough et al., 2023). These findings add support to the literature
that has consistently found that religion can be a tool in the hands of
many individuals, especially for at-risk African American youth.</p>
<p>Another area of his research focuses on risk factors affecting
positive youth development. For example, his dissertation implemented a
multidimensional growth mixture model (MGMM) to examine heterogeneity in
polysubstance use among a sample of adjudicated youth. After
establishing the number of substantive interpretations of the
polysubstance use classes, the manual three-step approach was used to
examine predictors of the classes, and the classes were used to predict
NEET (i.e., employment status and drop-out) status and social
relationships in young adulthood using logistic regression. The results
showed that three polysubstance use classes were identified: “Low-Use”,
“Poly-Use”, and “Tobacco-Dominant”. Additionally, classes of
polysubstance use partially influenced NEET status and significantly
influenced social relationships in young adulthood for adjudicated
youth. Specifically, those in the low-use class were significantly more
likely to have better friendships, romantic relationships, and community
involvement upon transition to young adulthood.</p>

<p>In today’s data-driven world, understanding and leveraging data has
become essential for professionals across industries. With an
ever-increasing volume of information being generated daily, the ability
to analyze and interpret data provides businesses with a competitive
advantage. Professionals who can harness the power of data are able to
make well-informed decisions and drive innovation within their
organizations. The availability of sophisticated tools and technologies
further enhances the capacity to collect, store, and analyze vast
amounts of data. This allows businesses to identify trends, patterns,
and insights that were previously inaccessible. In this context,
mastering skills such as data analysis, data visualization, and
statistical modeling has become crucial for professionals aiming to
excel in their careers. Moreover, the effective utilization of data
allows companies to optimize operations, improve customer experiences,
personalize marketing strategies, and develop new products or services
tailored to specific market segments. As such, in today’s professional
landscape, being proficient in utilizing data is no longer optional but
rather a prerequisite for success.</p>
<p>Due to these current data developments, Dr. Fairclough’s interests
have grown considerably to span outside the realms of academia.
Specifically, he has developed a keen interest in Data science. Data
science encompasses a range of interdisciplinary skills that involve
applying scientific methods and processes, algorithms, and systems to
extract knowledge and insights from structured or unstructured datasets.
By employing programming tools such as Python,R or SQL, individuals can
efficiently collect, clean, analyze, and visualize data. Moreover,
incorporating machine learning techniques enables professionals to
develop predictive models that detect patterns and make accurate
predictions. This shift towards incorporating data-driven insights
allows data professionals to make more informed decisions based on
objective evidence rather than relying solely on intuition or subjective
opinions. Ultimately, Dr. Fairclough believes that embracing the power
of data science equips professionals with the ability to uncover hidden
trends and patterns in large datasets, leading to better decision-making
and ultimately driving success in industries.</p>
